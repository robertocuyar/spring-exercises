                    Yum-Rando is a game-changing web application built to answer the age-old question of “what’s for
                    dinner?” Built using geolocation data from the Zomato restaurant API, Yum-Rando can suggest a
                    randomized restaurant for you that is near your location. You are also able to build a list using
                    local storage to randomize through. If you chose to become a registered user you will have the
                    ability to further customize your experience through self-generated lists that are saved to our
                    database with a unique title of your choosing, as well as the ability to review a restaurant and
                    adding photos through the Filestack API, and share your experience with your friends.
